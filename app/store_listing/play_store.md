Never forget a student's name again.

That awkward moment when you can't remember a student's name? We've all been there. NameDrill helps you learn and remember every name using the same science-backed technique medical students use to memorize thousands of facts: spaced repetition.

**HOW IT WORKS**

1. Add photos of your students (camera or gallery)
2. Practice with flashcards for 5 minutes a day
3. Remember names forever

It's that simple. The app shows you faces at the perfect time — just before you'd forget — so names stick in your long-term memory.

**TWO WAYS TO PRACTICE**

📚 **Learn Mode**
• Face → Name: See a face, recall the name
• Name → Face: See a name, picture the face
• "Got it" or "Forgot" — the app adjusts automatically
• Session summary shows your weak spots

⏱️ **Quiz Mode**
• 60-second timed challenges
• Multiple choice for fast practice
• Track high scores and daily streaks
• Perfect for a quick review before class

**ORGANIZE YOUR WAY**

• Create groups for each class, period, or team
• Add notes for each person (pronunciation tips, seating position, anything you need)
• Move people between groups
• See progress at a glance with photo grids

**PRIVACY FIRST**

Your students' photos are sensitive. We get it.

✅ All data stored locally on YOUR device
✅ No account required
✅ No cloud uploads
✅ No tracking or analytics
✅ Photos never leave your phone

You own your data. Period.

**BUILT FOR TEACHERS**

NameDrill was designed specifically for educators who face hundreds of new names every semester:

• K-12 teachers meeting new classes
• University professors with lecture halls
• Substitute teachers needing quick prep
• Teaching assistants managing sections
• Anyone who works with groups of people

**WORKS OFFLINE**

No internet? No problem. NameDrill works 100% offline. Practice on the bus, in the break room, or anywhere else.

**DARK MODE**

Easy on the eyes during late-night grading sessions. Switch manually or follow your system setting.

**FREE VS PREMIUM**

FREE (forever):
• 2 groups

No subscriptions. Buy once, use forever.

**DAILY REMINDERS**

Set a custom reminder time to build your habit. Smart notifications tell you which class needs review and keep your streak alive.

**THE SCIENCE**

NameDrill uses the SM-2 spaced repetition algorithm, the same system behind apps like Anki. When you mark a name as "Got it," the app waits longer before showing it again (1 day → 3 days → 7 days → 14 days). Names you forget appear more often until they stick.

Research shows spaced repetition is 50% more effective than traditional studying for long-term retention.
