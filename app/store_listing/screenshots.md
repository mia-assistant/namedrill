## Placeholder Face Sources

Use royalty-free, diverse face images for screenshots:
- [Generated Photos](https://generated.photos) — AI-generated faces (commercial use OK)
- [This Person Does Not Exist](https://thispersondoesnotexist.com) — AI-generated (check license)
- [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com) — Search "portrait" (free commercial use)

**Important:** Never use real student photos in marketing materials.

## App Preview Video (Optional)

**Duration:** 15-30 seconds

**Storyboard:**
1. (0-5s) Problem: Teacher at whiteboard, hesitates on name, awkward
2. (5-10s) Solution: Opens NameDrill, quick flashcard practice montage
3. (10-20s) Features: Quick cuts of Learn Mode, Quiz Mode, progress screen
4. (20-30s) Result: Same teacher confidently greeting student by name, smile

**Audio:** Upbeat background music, no voiceover (or simple "Learn names fast" VO)

## Notes for Designer

- Keep consistent visual language across all screenshots
- Use device frames (iPhone 15 Pro, Pixel 8) for professional look
- Background: Consider soft gradient or solid color that matches app theme
- Typography: Bold sans-serif for headlines (SF Pro Display or Roboto)
- Ensure text is readable at small sizes (app store thumbnails)
