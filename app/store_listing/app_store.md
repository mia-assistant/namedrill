## Description (4000 chars max)

Never forget a student's name again.

That awkward moment when you can't remember a student's name? We've all been there. NameDrill helps you learn and remember every name using spaced repetition — the same science-backed technique medical students use to memorize thousands of facts.

**HOW IT WORKS**

1. Add photos of your students
2. Practice with flashcards for 5 minutes a day
3. Remember names forever

The app shows you faces at the perfect time — just before you'd forget — so names stick in your long-term memory.

**TWO WAYS TO PRACTICE**

📚 LEARN MODE
• Face → Name or Name → Face flashcards
• Tap "Got it" or "Forgot" — the app adjusts
• Session summary shows your weakest names

⏱️ QUIZ MODE
• 60-second timed challenges
• Multiple choice for fast practice
• Track high scores and daily streaks
