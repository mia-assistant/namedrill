PRIVACY POLICY
NameDrill

Last updated: February 6, 2026

================================================================================

NameDrill is a name-learning flashcard app designed to help teachers remember
their students' names. We built it with your privacy in mind.

    🔒 We don't collect any of your data. Everything stays on your device.

================================================================================

DATA WE COLLECT
---------------
None.

NameDrill does not collect, transmit, or store any personal information on
external servers. We have no analytics, no tracking, and no third-party SDKs
that collect data.


YOUR DATA STAYS ON YOUR DEVICE
------------------------------
All information you enter into NameDrill — including:

  • Student names
  • Class groups
  • Photos you add
  • Your learning progress

...is stored ONLY on your device. We never see it, and it never leaves your
phone.


PHOTOS
------
Photos you take or import are stored locally on your device. They are never
uploaded to any server or shared with anyone. If you delete the app, the
photos stored within it are deleted too.


IN-APP PURCHASES
----------------
Premium features are available through the App Store (iOS) or Google Play
Store (Android). All payment processing is handled entirely by Apple or
Google. We do not receive or store any payment information — only
confirmation that a purchase was made.


CHILDREN'S PRIVACY
------------------
Since we don't collect any data, there's no personal information from
children (or anyone) to worry about. The app simply doesn't transmit data
off your device.


CHANGES TO THIS POLICY
----------------------
If we ever change this policy, we'll update the date at the top. But
honestly, our commitment is simple: your data is yours, and we don't want it.
